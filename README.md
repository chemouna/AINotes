# Ai 

## Artificial Neural network
- computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks, where they learn progressively to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming.
- For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and 
  using the results to identify cats in other images. 

- tensorflow is a numerical computation library
